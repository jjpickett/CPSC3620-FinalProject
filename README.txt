1) To run the program, open up the folder where the CPSC3620-Project.jar is located.

The program will then ask you to choose what you would like to test. 
1. Insertion
2. Deletion

After selecting one of the first 3 options you are taken to another screen that will
ask you the amount of integers you would like to test with.
1. 100
2. 500
3. 1000
4. 2500

After one of these options are chosen, the prompt will then display the time it took to complete the
operations as well as the amount of memory used. If you choose to go back from this prompt, you 
will be taken to the previous prompt. 

If Quit is chosen at any time the program will say "Good Bye!" and the program will end.
